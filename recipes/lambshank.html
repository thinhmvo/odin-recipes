        Braised meat is always a good idea. Braising is a technique that
        involves meat soaked in liquid, cooked for a long time at a low
        temperature. Lamb shank pappardelle recipe is very Italian as the
        braising liquid is made from red wine and pureed tomatoes. Many cuisines
        use different types of liquids and flavoring. Stock is a predominant of
        many different recipes, as well as the trilogy of vegetables that
        Italians call ‘soffritto’ (onions, carrots and celery) with garlic.
        Asian dishes may use peppercorn, star anise and cinnamon while Italians
        or French will focus more on building flavor with fresh herbs as bay
        leaves, thyme or rosemary. Not a fan of gamey meat? No worries for this
        one, the lamb flavor that someone may describe as strong surely mellows
        downs when combined with wine and tomatoes. In this recipe the lamb
        shanks are tossed with pappardelle, similar to but larger than
        tagliatelle, but it can also be served with mashed potatoes, soft
        polenta or roasted potatoes. Buon appetito!
