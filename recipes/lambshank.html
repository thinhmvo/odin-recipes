      <h2>Presentation</h2>
      <p>
        Braised meat is always a good idea. Braising is a technique that
        involves meat soaked in liquid, cooked for a long time at a low
        temperature. Lamb shank pappardelle recipe is very Italian as the
        braising liquid is made from red wine and pureed tomatoes. Many cuisines
        use different types of liquids and flavoring. Stock is a predominant of
        many different recipes, as well as the trilogy of vegetables that
        Italians call ‘soffritto’ (onions, carrots and celery) with garlic.
        Asian dishes may use peppercorn, star anise and cinnamon while Italians
        or French will focus more on building flavor with fresh herbs as bay
        leaves, thyme or rosemary. Not a fan of gamey meat? No worries for this
        one, the lamb flavor that someone may describe as strong surely mellows
        downs when combined with wine and tomatoes. In this recipe the lamb
        shanks are tossed with pappardelle, similar to but larger than
        tagliatelle, but it can also be served with mashed potatoes, soft
        polenta or roasted potatoes. Buon appetito!

      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <h3>How To Prepare Lamb Shank Pappardelle</h3>
      <p>
        Season lamb shanks with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large, heavy pot
        or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook shanks until brown on all
        sides, about 8 minutes. Add rosemary, carrots, onions, celery and garlic
        to the pot and sauté over medium heat until golden brown, about 10
        minutes. Add red wine on high heat and reduce by half. Add tomato puree,
        mix everything. Bring to a boil, cover, and cook in the oven at 325F for
        at least 2 hours, until the meat is fall off the bone tender. Make the
        pasta dough. Mix the two flours and put them on a counter or working
        surface and make a well. Break the eggs into the well with a fork, whisk
        them, then gradually mix with the flours until a ball is formed. Knead
        by hand. Flour the surface. Push the dough away from you with the palm
        of your hand, fold the dough over itself and turn it counterclockwise.
        Continue pushing, folding, and turning until the dough is smooth and
        elastic, 15 to 20 minutes. Wrap in plastic and let the dough rest for at
        least one hour. Roll out the dough. Starting in the middle, push away
        from you with a rolling pin, easing up on the pressure as you approach
        the edge. Dust with some flour if dough sticks to rolling pin. Continue
        rolling the dough into a sheet, turning occasionally, until you can see
        your fingers through the bottom. Cut the pappardelle. Dust the top of
        the sheet of dough with semolina flour and loosely roll it into a
        cylinder. Using a sharp knife, cut into 3/4-inch to 1 inch-wide slices.
        Unwrap the noodles; dust with more semolina to prevent from sticking and
        gently toss to separate. Place on a sheet pan and cover with a kitchen
        towel until ready to cook. Take the lamb out of the oven. The meat
        should be so tender that you can separate it from the bone just with a
        fork. Remove all the meat from the bone and keep the sauce warm while
        you cook the pasta. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the
        pappardelle, one piece at the time so it doesn’t stick. Pasta will float
        soon, cook for 2 minutes more than transfer into the lamb sauce. Turn
        the heat on high and add a generous ladle of pasta water with a drizzle
        of olive oil. The starch from the pasta water will thicken up the sauce
        to a perfect consistency. Toss the pasta around in the sauce and cook
        for a few minutes so the pasta can absorb this incredibly delicious
        sauce. Add some fresh parsley. Plate in your most beautiful pasta bowls
        and grate a generous amount of Parmigiano Reggiano. Buon appetito!
